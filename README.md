# spotify-image-tool
Get images from Spotify: the profile picture of an artist or the cover image of a song, an album, or a playlist.

## How do I use this tool?
Head over to the web page: https://promisecoder.github.io/spotify-image-tool/.

Input the URL (or the ID) of a Spotify page.

## What did you use to make this tool?
The basics: Google, Stack Overflow, and the Spotify API documentation

## Why did you make this? Can't I just use Inspect?
I made this because I am a sad child whose only computer is her beloved school-owned Chromebook, where Inspect is disabled.

## What do *I* use this for?
This tool is useful for playlists. For higher-quality album art, try a web search.

This tool does not work for artist banners or user profile images. You are welcome to figure out how yourself.
