This tool is useful for playlists. For higher-quality album art, try a web search. This tool does not work for artist banners or user profile images. You are welcome to figure out how yourself.

## What did you use to make this tool?
The basics: Google, Stack Overflow, and the Spotify API documentation

## Why did you make this? Can't I just use the Inspect tool?
I made this because I am a sad child whose only device is her beloved school-owned Chromebook, where the Inspect tool is disabled.
